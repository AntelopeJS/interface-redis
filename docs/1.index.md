# Redis Interface

## Overview

The Redis interface provides direct access to Redis client functionality, allowing you to interact with Redis servers for key-value storage, pub/sub messaging, and other Redis operations.

For more information about Redis itself, refer to the [official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/).

## Dependencies

- [**redis**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis): The Node.js Redis client that this interface depends on. This package provides the core functionality for connecting to and interacting with Redis servers.

## Features

- Simple Redis client access through a promise-based API
- Connection management with automatic reconnection
- Full access to all Redis commands through the underlying client
- Support for transactions, pub/sub, and other Redis features

## Core Functions

### GetClient

Retrieves the initialized Redis client instance.

```typescript
import { GetClient } from "@ajs/redis/beta";

// Usage example
async function example() {
  const redisClient = await GetClient();
  // Now you can use the Redis client directly
  await redisClient.set("key", "value");
  const value = await redisClient.get("key");
}
```

#### Returns

- Promise<RedisClientType>: A promise that resolves to the Redis client instance
